Modding tool for the .GIZ file in Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga

My goal for this project is to provide a tool that assists in level modding and that prioritizes the editing of gizmos. The .GIT, .GSC, and other files may be explored for the sake of enhancing the gizmo editing experience. As a long term goal, I may want to transform this editor into a full level editor that can edit all level related files, but this a long ways away and it is unlikely I will accomplish or even attempt to accomplish this. I have no plans for fitting this tool for any Lego games other than Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga.
